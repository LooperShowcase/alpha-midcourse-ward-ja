    <h1>some things about how amazon started ?</h1>
    <h5>Founding</h5>
    <p>
      The company was created as a result of what Jeff Bezos called his "regret
      minimization framework", which described his efforts to fend off any
      regrets for participating sooner in the Internet business boom during that
      time.[1] In 1994, Bezos left his employment as vice-president of D. E.
      Shaw & Co., a Wall Street firm, and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he
      began to work on a business plan[2] for what would become Amazon.com. On
      July 5, 1994, Bezos initially incorporated the company in Washington state
      with the name Cadabra, Inc.[3] After a few months, he changed the name to
      Amazon.com, Inc, because a lawyer misheard its original name as
      "cadaver".[4] In its early days, the company was operated out of the
      garage of Bezos's house on Northeast 28th Street in Bellevue, Washington.[

    <h5>Choosing a name</h5>
    <p>
      Bezos selected the name by looking through a dictionary; he settled on
      "Amazon" because it was a place that was "exotic and different", just as
      he had envisioned for his Internet enterprise. The Amazon River, he noted,
      was the biggest river in the world, and he planned to make his store the
      biggest bookstore in the world.[6] Additionally, a name that began with
      "A" was preferred because it would probably be at the top of an
      alphabetized list.[6] Bezos placed a premium on his head start in building
      a brand and told a reporter, "There's nothing about our model that can't
      be copied over time. But you know, McDonald's got copied. And it's still
      built a huge, multibillion-dollar company. A lot of it comes down to the
      brand name. Brand names are more important online than they are in the
      physical world."[

    <h5>Online bookstore and IPO</h5>
    <p>
      After reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected
      annual web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products
      that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were
      the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer
      hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that
      his new business would sell books online, because of the large worldwide
      demand for literature, the low unit price for books, and the huge number
      of titles available in print.[8] Amazon was founded in the garage of
      Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington.[6][9][10] Bezos' parents
      invested almost $250,000 in the start-up.[11] In July 1995, Amazon opened
      as an online bookseller, selling the world's largest collection of books
      to anyone with World Wide Web access.[12] The first book sold on
      Amazon.com was Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies:
      Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought.[13] In the first
      two months of business, Amazon sold to all 50 states and over 45
      countries. Within two months, Amazon's sales were up to $20,000/week.[14]
      In October 1995, the company announced itself to the public.[15] In 1996,
      it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public
      offering of stock on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, trading under the
      NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN.[16] Barnes & Noble sued Amazon on May
      12, 1997, alleging that Amazon's claim to be "the world's largest
      bookstore" was false because it "...wasn't a bookstore at all. It's a book
      broker." The suit was later settled out of court and Amazon continued to
      make the same claim.[17] Walmart sued Amazon on October 16, 1998, alleging
      that Amazon had stolen Walmart's trade secrets by hiring former Walmart
      executives. Although this suit was also settled out of court, it caused
      Amazon to implement internal restrictions and the reassignment of the
      former Walmart executives.[17] In 1999, Amazon first attempted to enter
      the publishing business by buying a defunct imprint, "Weathervane", and
      publishing some books "selected with no apparent thought", according to
      The New Yorker. The imprint quickly vanished again, and as of 2014 Amazon
      representatives said that they had never heard of it.[18] Also in 1999,
      Time magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the
      company's success in popularizing online shopping.
